"int foo(string);": function prototype/header; precedes definition/implementation
"int": return type
"foo": function name
"string": input parameter type

By default, C++ functions create a COPY of their arguments.

We can circumvent this by passing by REFERENCE: prefix an argument's name
with an ampersand (&) in its function's prototype and definition.

Use the keyword "const" to prevent the variable associated with the reference
from being modified.

STRING METHODS

pos: index/position of character
num: number of characters

.size():                Length of string in characters
.at(pos):               Character at position
[pos]:                  Character at position
.insert():              (Various functions)
.erase(pos, num):       Erase characters from string
.replace():             (Various functions)
.c_str():               Convert string to C string (i.e., character array)
.find(substr, pos):     Find substring starting from pos
.rfind(substr):         Find *last* substring
.substr(pos, num):      Get substring from string
