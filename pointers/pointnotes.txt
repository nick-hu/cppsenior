NOTES ON POINTERS

] int x;        | allocates memory for 'x' (4 bytes in this case)
] x = 1;        | initializes 'x' to 1 -- can also be done by 'int x(1);' or 'int x = 1;'
] int* p;       | 'p', a POINTER, stores a memory location (address)

The pointer must be declared as int* because it will refer to the address of an int.
(The next line will fail otherwise.)

] p = &x;       | 'p' is the ADDRESS OF (&) x
] cout << x;    | 'x' is inserted into cout stream
] cout << *p;   | 'p' is DEREFERENCED and x is inserted into cout stream

The AMOUNT of memory read when a pointer is dereferenced is dictated by the POINTER TYPE!
